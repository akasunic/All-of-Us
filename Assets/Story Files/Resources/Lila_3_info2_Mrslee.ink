-> Chat2
* Mrs.Lee, can I ask a question?
-> Explain1

Mrslee?Smiling "Good! I love water fitness class! My friends meet there every week. And now, maybe, I will have new friends in class."
Mrslee?Smiling "Afterwards, we get lunch together and talk about our families, about our gardens, about getting older."

* That sounds like so much fun! 
-> Chat3
* I love that! Hey, do you have a minute for a question?

Mrslee?Neutral "I have weekly video calls with old friends. We invite new friends sometimes, like I include a few ladies from fitness class. I feel really supported."
Mrslee?Neutral "Making new friends used to feel hard, but going to class and the library helped me meet new friends and get to know acquaintances I didn’t know I had much in common with."
Mrslee?Neutral "A woman from the library also lost her husband. We bonded and spend time together a lot now. I find friends in so many places."
Mrslee?Smiling "It can be easy to forget the people right nearby. Tell your friend to think about who they talked to this week. Follow up with them."

* Ah, I see. Do you know how Eddie has made new friends?

Mrslee?Smiling "Eddie always asks friends to go with him to new places. He says "You come with me, I go with you." So, new places always feel safe." 
Mrslee?Smiling "That helps me because every new class has one friend, it seems. Every new class is safe."
Mrslee?Smiling "In a new place, having buddy can be very special. It makes him feel okay to go alone later."
